This study predicts the number of arrivals at the Athens International Airport using various machine learning models. The primary goal of the research is to discover which category of models achieves better results based on this data. Additionally, the objective is to discover the best way to manage the data as well as the exogenous variables to improve predictions. One of the main conclusions that will be presented later is that ensemble models achieved the best results. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that converting the data to stationary did not significantly improve the models' predictions. Finally, it is important to note that including exogenous variables such as time, quarantine measures, and the number of vaccinated citizens against Covid-19 did not improve the predictions.
